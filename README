Small tool for typing automation, of all serials you may have to insert anywere. Smart and useful for people working on computer maintenance.

This tools runs using Java Jre, may sound bad, but works on every single computer in the world (okay, not true, but on most computers).

=
Moron - "Hey, so I have do install the JRE before using it? Thats crap!"
Killer - "I have a mini JRE with me... Moron."

Sorry about that...

Basically, everything will run on a pendrive, but can be installed just by moving the folder.
